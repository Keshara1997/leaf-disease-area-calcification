Agriculture industry is one of the most important sources of foreign exchange and 
employment when considering the Sri Lankan market. Therefore, small crops play an 
important role in food security of people as it is an integral component of Sri Lankan cuisine. 
However, according to industry experts, inefficient management of many diseases and pests 
hampers the production. It is considered as an issue that needs proper action and attention
which can be achieved using ICT technologies. Hence, this study proposes a smart system 
that assists farmers and agriculture professionals in providing farmer education, disease and 
infestation management, and progression level calculations to aid farmers and agriculture 
professionals in uplifting the agriculture industry in Sri Lanka. The developed AI-based 
mobile application system for Brinjal Diseases based on eating patterns is a clever approach 
that can identify the illness that poses the greatest threat to Brinjal, specifically leafhopper 
damage.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm and image processing 
techniques will distinguish between healthy and suspicious (unhealthy) leaflets in a plant. For 
disease diagnosis, only suspicious leaf images are extracted and classified by comparing
features using transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore, 
identified disease details with its precautionary measures will be displayed. 
The users will be given an augmented reality experience in which they will be able to identify 
and learn about the causative agent/insect that is responsible for the infestation, thereby 
assisting farmer education and empowering individuals to continue cultivating through selflearning and awareness.
The custom Mask R-CNN model will be used to identify the level of progression that the 
disease has reached, and the system will notify the user of the risk and damage caused by the 
disease. Finally, all details are statistically visualized to manage the agricultural lands 
properly.
